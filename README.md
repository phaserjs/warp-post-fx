Warp Post FX
============

**Vesion 1.0.0**

Welcome to the Warp Post FX Pack.

This pack and all examples in it require [Phaser 3.52](https://phaser.io) or above. Like all Post FX Pipelines it only works in WebGL.

To get started open a command-line prompt and enter:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the dependencies for this pack.

Then issue the command:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will run a local instance of http-serve and open your default web browser at the examples folder. From here you can select any example to run it and view the code. Use the drop-down menu at the top to quickly navigate between the Warp Post FX examples.

If you have your own development server already set-up then feel free to map a site to this pack folder, so you can browse to examples. All paths within the examples are relative, so should work at any directory depth.

The structure of this pack is as follows:

*   ðŸ“‚ **dist** - In this folder you will find WarpPostFX.js which is an ESM (ES6 Module), an ES5 version called WarpPostFX.es5.js and also TypeScript Definitions: WarpPostFX.d.ts.
*   ðŸ“‚ **docs** - In this folder you will find the documentation for the Warp Post FX.
*   ðŸ“‚ **examples** - In this folder you will find the Warp Post FX examples runner, demonstrating a variety of ways in which you can use this effect.
*   ðŸ“‚ **examples/assets** - In this folder you will find the assets that the examples use. Please note, these assets are not open-source and you will require a license to use them in your own games.
*   ðŸ“‚ **examples/src** - In this folder you will find the source code to each of the examples, written in ES6 Module format.
*   ðŸ“‚ **src** - In this folder you will find the original TypeScript source code for the Warp Post FX.

Feel free to use either of the provided bundles found in the dist folder, or import the original TypeScript source code into your own project and use it directly.

The documentation explains how to import and use Warp Post FX in your game. Also, be sure to look at the example source code. It often contains a lot more useful snippets!

A lot of work and effort went into producing the Warp Post FX Pack and we truly hope you find it useful for your games.
